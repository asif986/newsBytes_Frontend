## Architecture

    Main objective of the Architecture is separation concerns and DRY (Don't repeat yourself).
    I developed complete application with the help of following Technologies.

    Frontend - Angular with ng Zorro framework
    Backend - Node (Express js) with Mongodb

    The Angular is a most Frontend framework. with the help of we can create single page application
    Reasons -
    1.Fast performance
    2.Excellent Security etc..

    The Node is a javascript runtime, with the help of express js we can easily developed the API's

    The MongoDB database is an Nosql Database. fast-growing database no releations projects.

## Repository Information -

    This Repository contains the (dev_asif branch). dev_asif branch contains updated code.

# UrlShortFrontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
